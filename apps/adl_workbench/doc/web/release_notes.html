		<h3>8 Sep 2011 ADL 1.5 beta Release 4 (<a href="http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_eiffel/!svn/bc/1603/BRANCHES/adl1.5/">SVN rev 1603</a>) (<a href="http://www.openehr.org/issues/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&mode=hide&sorter/order=DESC&sorter/field=priority&resolution=-1&pid=10070&fixfor=10080">Jira</a>)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>GUI changes
				<ul>
					<li>The <b>GUI is now <a href="images/docking_side_by_side_definitions.png">docking-based</a></b>, allowing greater flexibility in placement of visual components.  Visually, multiple archetypes can now be loaded simultaneously, and docked side-by-side for visual comparison. This visual layout is the same model used in most modern tabbed editing and browsing tools. Underneath, the tool now properly supports multiple open archetypes and templates.
						<ul>
							<li>A new archetype tool is created either using ctrl-T (as for most web browsers) or from the new context (right click) menu available on an archetype or template in the explorer tol on the left.</li>
							<li>The language choice combo, and flat/differential view button are therefore now on each individual archetype tool, rather than being tool-wide.</li>
							<li>The status, error and statistics tools are now <a href="images/compile_1.png">docked along the bottom</a> and popup on left-click, in the manner typical of most programming IDEs.</li>
							<li>The profile chooser has moved to the top-left, in the place typically used to select 'projects' in most IDEs</li>
							<li>The 'test' tool is now shown as a <a href="images/test_tool.png">docked component</a> minimised on the right hand side, where it used to be. However, now it is a normal dockable component, so can be arranged in the same screen space as the other components, or even popped out into its own independent window, e.g. to be displayed on a separate screen.</li>
							<li>The docking tool layout is currently remembered over sessions by being saved in its own file. Because of the inherent complexity of docking and interaction with the operating system, the layout can occasionally disappear or seem non-sensical, usually due to a problem with the file. A 'reset visual layout' option is available from the View menu to correct this.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>New Reference Model Browser</b>: 
						<ul>
							<li>A <a href="images/rm_schema_tool.png">new tool</a> on the left hand side of the main screen allows multiple Reference Models to be browsed and explored. Clicking on any class causes the class to be displyed in the Class Tool, in a new tab.</li>
							<li>Classes from different RMs can be <a href="images/rm_schema_tool_duplex_classes.png">viewed side-by-side</a> using different class tools and docking system to arrange the panes.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Enhanced search bar</b>: 
						<ul>
							<li>The <a href="images/address_bar.png">address bar</a> now supports searching for classes as well as archetpes, depending on which of the RM browser or Archetype Catalog is active.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Archetype definition visualisation enhanced</b>: 
						<ul>
							<li>It is now possible to include a set of RM-specific icons for <a href="images/apgar_RM_icons.png">visualising the definition tree</a>. These icons have to be located in the install area icons/&lt;rm_name&gt; directory, e.g. icons/openehr. Viewing with these icons or the generic ones is now an option available from the option dialog and also from the definition node tree.</li>
							<li>The <a href="images/apgar_RM_icons_RM_attrs.png">reference model attributes</a> can now be visualised independently of other changes to the view.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Class tool enhanceed</b>: 
						<ul>
							<li>Left-clicking on a class node in the explorer on the left populates the 'class tool' (now just another tool, tabbed with the archetype tools) with the compositional 'closure' of the chosen class. This is <a href="images/explorer_class_view.png">visualised</a> as a tree of alternating type nodes and property nodes, in a similar to the node visualisation of an archetype.</li>
							<li>Some of the class nodes are abstract, or even if concrete, have subtypes defined. Right-clicking on these nodes in the class tool, brings up a context menu containing the subtypes defined in the reference model, and selecting one causes <a href="images/explorer_class_view_subtypes.png">re-population</a> of that node in the tree downward with the chosen type.</li>
							<li>As with the archetype tool, right clicking on a class node allows a new tool to be created instead of populating the existing one. Class tools can also be delted from the docking container.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>ADL/<a href="images/xml_serialisation.png">XML</a> serialisation version now choosable in main GUI window, rather than only in the options. This option changes the format of ADL and XML output to conform to the chosen ADL release (1.4 or 1.5)</li>
				</ul>
				<li><b>Serialisation: dADL and rule-driven XML added</b>:
					<ul>
						<li>Empty items are no longer populated, e.g. 'contributors'.</li>
						<li>Added dADL (the openEHR object serialisation syntax, identical in aim to JSON) serialisation, where an archetype object (AOM) structure can be serialised to a pure dADL structure. A special set of P_XXX classes were added to simplify some fields, e.g. occurrences etc to Strings, since otherwise they take up many lines of dADL. The use of this feature is for post-parsed archetypes to be stored in a pure object format for fast retrieval later, bypassing the main compiler.</li>
						<li>Added proof-of-concept XML serialisation, also based on the P_XXX classes, as well as a rule file which enables control over XML what object properties are output as XML attributes, and other options. This XML is not currently synchronsed to either the published ADL 1.4 XSD, or any ADL 1.5 XSD.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Compiler
					<ul>
						<li>Archetype validation is now 3 phases, where the last phase operates on the flattened archetype.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</li>
			<li>Source code: tools upgraded to Eiffel 6.8 GPL.</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li>Archetype annotations implemented:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="learning_adl_15.html#annotations">details</a>;</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.openehr.org/svn/knowledge2/TRUNK/archetypes/ADL_1.5_test/validity/annotations/">example archetypes</a>;</li>
					<li>specifications: <a href="http://www.openehr.org/svn/specification/TRUNK/publishing/architecture/rm/common_im.pdf">common IM (section 7)</a>, <a href="http://www.openehr.org/svn/specification/TRUNK/publishing/architecture/am/adl1.5.pdf">ADL 1.5 (section 9.8)</a>;</li>
				</ul>
			<li>More flexible RM schemas, now nestable and clearer syntax (<a href="tool_configuration.html#rm_schema_configuration">details</a>);</li>
			<li>Signficantly improved GUI:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="images/overview.png">main screen</a>;</li>
					<li>Easier loading and viewing of RM schema files, with <a href="images/options_rm_schema_config.png">new dedicated dialog</a>;</li>
					<li><a href="images/repository_setting.png">Improved dialog</a> for configuring repository profiles;</li>
					<li>fixed various bugs, including wrong UTF rendering in keywords and contributors, archetype and template selection problems;</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Added initial version of OPERATIONAL_TEMPLATE class;</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug in path generation;</li>
			<li>Migrate to dADL format configuration .cfg file, providing greater readability and flexibility <a href="tool_configuration.html#cfg_file">(details)</a>;</li>
			<li>Upgraded source code to Eiffel 6.7.</li>
		</ul>
        <h3>28 Sep 2010 ADL 1.5 beta Release 2 (<a href="http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_eiffel/!svn/bc/1247/BRANCHES/specialisation/">SVN rev 1247</a>):</h3>

        <ul>
			<li value="0">Added regression testing facility so that any archetype can now include in its description section an expected compilation result, such as 'PASS', 'FAIL', or a validity code e.g. 'VSONIL'. This enables all the current test archetypes (found <a href="http://www.openehr.org/svn/knowledge2/TRUNK/archetypes/">here</a>) to be used by any compiler in any language in the same way. The ADL Workbench now has a button which turns on this facility on the test page. See <a href="test_tool.html">Test tool page</a> for details;</li>

		  <li>Fixed bugs that prevented constraint bindings being read in correctly, and also errors being correctly reported from the parsing of the archetype ontology;</li>
		  <li value="0">improve validation of languages, now minimally enforce IETF language-tag format (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646">RFC 5646</a> - this is the one that defines strings like "en" and "en-GB". This class contains functions for exact matching, validation and matching a language subtag e.g. "en" to a full tag e.g. "en" or "en-GB", "en-AU" etc);</li>
          <li value="0">fixed a bug in the 2nd pass validator that was sometimes preventing subtrees in specialised archetypes from being correctly validated against their correspondents in parent archetypes</li>
          <li value="0">Fix various launch / shut-down / minimise annoyances, especially on multiple screen systems;</li>
          <li value="0">Fix node map rendering problem where multiple value attributes with existence = 1 not showing up in red but pink. Existence is now taken into account for this rendering.</li>
          <li value="0">Added profile chooser combo box to archetype explorer on main page;</li>
          <li value="0">Archetype id search facility added to id control on main page. This allows any id substring to be matched to available archetypes, generating a picklist for the user. E.g. the user could enter 'exam' and the list will show all archetypes containing this string;</li>
          <li value="0">Improved validation for VSONIR cases; comparison of ranges for existence, occurrences and cardinality comparison in specialised archetype validation no longer treats equal ranges as a legal redefinition (since in terms of constraint logic, only strictly narrower ranges are valid redefinitions);</li>
          <li value="0">moved error database to files under $app_install/error_db;</li>
		  <li value="0">Addition and refactoring of code base to create new applications:
		  	<ul>
				<li>GUI Dadl testing app;</li>
				<li>ADL compiler app simulating app, designed to show within the Eiffel environment what kind of calls an application (possibly written in another language) would make to use the compiler;</li>
				<li>ADL compiler C lib-generating, which generates the compiler as a pure C library in both static and dynamic link forms, with all GUI removed. This can be directly inked in with applications written in C, C++, Java, via JNI, or any .Net language.</li>
				<li>Example application written in C using the statically linked form of the above library, to illustrate its use.</li>
			</ul>
		  </li>

          <li value="0">Release notes now displayed in default browser at installation time;</li>
          <li value="0">Updates to help pages, including Mac installer and regression test facility.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>11 Aug 2010 ADL 1.5 beta Release 1 (<a href=
        "http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_eiffel/!svn/bc/1105/BRANCHES/specialisation/">SVN rev 1105</a>):</h3>

        <ul>
          <li value="0">Improved validation, with code-based error messages matching ADL and AOM 1.5 <a href="http://www.openehr.org/svn/specification/TRUNK/publishing/roadmap.html">draft&nbsp;specifications</a> (see bottom of page);</li>
          <li value="0">Support for referencing from one archetype to another without slots;</li>
          <li value="0">Support for ADL 1.5 templates, including slot-filling and exclusions;</li>
          <li value="0">Separate explorers for archetypes and templates;</li>
          <li value="0">Multiple RM schemas can be loaded and managed in the options dialog;</li>
          <li value="0">Archetype files can now be arranged anywhere on the file-system; compiler uses RM and specialisation relationships to build directory in tool;</li>
          <li value="0">Repositories are now defined / selected using profiles;</li>
          <li value="0">Archetype search facility;</li>
          <li value="0">An initial 13606 schema is available, allowing validation of EN 13606 archetypes.</li>
          <li value="0">Test function changed to prevent any .adl file overwriting; instead, outputs files for viewing
          in diff tools.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>22 Mar 2009 ADL 1.5 Preview Release 1.5.0 (<a href=
        "http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_eiffel/!svn/bc/851/BRANCHES/specialisation/">SVN rev 851</a>):</h3>

        <ul>
          <li value="0">performs stricter validation than previous versions, now reporting 40 syntax errors, 47
          validity errors, and 4 validity warnings.</li>

          <li value="0">Errors are more clearly differentiated into the following categories:</li>

          <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none; DISPLAY: inline" value="0">
            <ul>
              <li value="0">syntax error: the file is not valid ADL - shown in red</li>

              <li value="0">validity error: the archetype semantics are not valid when validated against parent
              archetypes and the reference model - shown in orange</li>

              <li value="0">validity warning: the semantics are valid, but there are redundant elements or other small
              issues to correct - shown in yellow</li>

              <li value="0">passed - shown in green</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li value="0">improved error reporting.</li>

          <li value="0">it now uses the reference model (RM) to validate all archetypes. The reference model is
          currently expressed in a custom meta-model format which is much simpler than UML 2 based meta-models, e.g.
          XMI (<a href=
          "http://www.openehr.org/wiki/display/dev/Machine-readable+model+representations+of+openEHR">why</a>?). The
          meta-model can be found <a href="http://www.openehr.org/svn/knowledge2/TRUNK/rm_schemas/">here</a>. Both the
          location of this file, and its design may change in the future, and its current format should not be taken as
          normative for openEHR.</li>

          <li value="0">RM attributes are now shown in the node map visualisation (<a href=
          "images/rm_differential.png">differential form</a>, <a href="images/rm_flat.png">flattened form</a>). In the
          differential view, only attributes defined on the concrete class mentioned in the archetype are shown; in the
          flat view, all inherited attributes are shown.</li>

          <li value="0">A new&nbsp;test has been added to the test page that allows original ADL fles to be overwritten
          with the result of the flattening operation on archetypes. THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL and should be used with care
          - it will really overwrite ADL files, so be sure to use it in a version-controlled context, such as SVN
          (where you can conveniently then see diffs of the files). For this reason, both the &#39;Save ADL&#39; and
          &#39;Save ADLS&#39; tests now require checkboxes to be checked before they will operate. The intention of the
          new &#39;Save ADL&#39; operation is to experiment with removal of some kinds of errors from legacy ADL
          fles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>02 Apr 2008 Release 1.4.1 (<a href=
          "http://www.openehr.org/svn/ref_impl_eiffel/TAGS/Release-1.4.1">SVN rev 599 / TAG Release-1.4.1</a>)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li value="0">The Archetype workbench now functions as a compiler over the entire archteype
              &#39;directory&#39; (the merged result of the reference and work repositories). With a single command
              (F7; build repository), all archetypes are compiled, and an error report built up which can be perused at
              any time. Slot relationships between archetypes are now shown, as are statistics for the
              repositories.</li>

              <li value="0">user history of archetypes visited;</li>

              <li value="0">The workbench now works using two kinds of files: differential &#39;source&#39; files
              (.adls extension) and flat files (.adl extension). Previously, .adl files were treated as the source of
              all archetypes. There are now two kinds of files:

                <ul>
                  <li value="0"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">.adls file</span>: this will become the
                  &#39;source&#39; file type for all archetypes.&nbsp;</li>

                  <li value="0"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">.adl file</span>: this will become the file type
                  for&nbsp;the &#39;flat&#39; &nbsp;view of an archetype. In the future, .adl files will no longer be
                  stored, but will be generated on the fly.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li value="0">for existing archetype repositories consisting of .adl files, the .adl file will be treated
              as the initial source. A .adls file will be generated once only for each .adl file, and from then on, the
              .adls file will be used as the source.</li>

              <li value="0">slot and used-by maps;</li>

            <ul>
              <li>enhancements

                <ul>
                  <li>all ISO date/time constraint patterns now include the &#39;T&#39; where appropriate, but parser
                  tolerates a space for the moment, and silently substitutes a &#39;T&#39; on output</li>

                  <li>ISO8601 duration constraint patterns now possible. See basic_types archetype in test archetypes
                  area for examples property attribute value in C_QUANTITY dADL sections now upgraded to CODE_PHRASE as
                  defined by openEHR Archetype profile spec.</li>

                  <li>Existing archetypes with old form of property = &lt;&quot;xxxxx&quot;&gt; still parse but are
                  silently converted to property = &lt;[openehr:xxxx]&gt; (note spaces converted to &#39;_&#39; as
                  well)</li>

                  <li>clear_xxx routines added to ARCHETYPE_DESCRIPTION and ARCHETYPE_DESCRIPTION_ITEM to allow all
                  list attributes (e.g. author, keywords, details, other_details etc) to be cleared in one go.</li>

                  <li>implemented &#39;adl_version&#39; and &#39;controlled&#39; markers in ADL files. Existing ADL
                  files opened and saved with the ADL workbench or other tool using this parser will have the latest
                  ADL version written into them.</li>

                  <li>added functions to ARCHETYPE_ONTOLOGY to remove terms and constraints completely.</li>

                  <li>added a function to ARCHETYPE to generate list of unused term and constraint codes, and to delete
                  them from the ontology.</li>
                </ul>

                  characters; if no &#39;T&#39; present in value, it parses fine (for now) but a &#39;T&#39; is
                  included on output.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>implemented ARCHETYPE_DESCRIPTION class, parsing, and GUI view. Upgraded all test archetypes. - added
              new class DT_OBJECT_CONVERTER, which performs generic DT_ &lt;-&gt; object structure conversion. This
              enables the archetype description and any other dADL content to be converted automatically into objects,

            <ul>
              <li>DT structures (the internal representation of dADL sections) are all generically generated from
              objects and are used to generate objects. This means that C_QUANTITYs, the description section and so on
              of an archetype are all handled by the one piece of code now. The ontology section is slightly more
              complex, since its current modelling does not correspond strictly to the object types used in the class
              ARCHETYPE_ONTOLOGY. This will change in the future.</li>

              values for primitive types and domain types C_QUANTITY, C_CODED_TEXT, C_ORDINAL. C_PRIMITIVE and all
              subtypes, as well as C_DOMAIN_TYPE have assumed_value, default_value, has_assumed_value and

              nodes - bug fixes - an error whereby archetypes with include and exclude lists sent the parser into an
              infinite loop is fixed. - empty C_DOMAIN_TYPE sections now parse, e.g. {C_QUANTITY &lt;&gt;} - embedded

            <h3>interim release BitKeeper cset 1.27 - 19 September 2004</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>enhancements

                <ul>
                  <li>finished inline dADL support for C_DOMAIN_TYPE subtypes; correctly serialises now; use of
                  parantheses corrected - file names for serialisations other than ADL now replace the &#39;.adl&#39;
                  extension at the end rather than just appending &#39;.html&#39;, &#39;.xml&#39; or whatever. - bug
                  fixes - fix workbench crash if icon not available (black square now shows, plus message indicating
                  which icon missing).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

            <h3>interim release BitKeeper cset 1.23 - 09 September 2004</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>GUI fixes:

                <ul>
                  <li>added option dialog; tool now asks for editor and repository path if no .cfg file found on
                  startup, and writes settings to .cfg file in startup directory - specialisated archetypes have a
                  differnt icon in archetype explorer - specialised archetype parent archetype id now shown in GUI -
                  general GUI size &amp; widget cleanup - Bug fixes: - unused parent codes in specialised archetypes no
                  longer generate warnings - Enhancements: - ASSERTION-building factory routines exposed in interface -
                  ontology sections all now save in sorted order of keys - ADL_INTERFACE has an attribute called
                  openehr_version which contains the automatically version information from the software repository -
                  useful for reporting bugs, using in &#39;about&#39; window.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>interim release BitKeeper cset 1.3.1.30 - 29 July 2004</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>added archetype explorer control on left side of tool - fixed error where empty term definition text
              caused crash - corrected validation of found use_node paths - corrected error where sibling object nodes
              with same code caused crash.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>interim release BitKeeper cset 1.3.1.22 - 05 May 2004</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>re-engineered object models as described in draft ADL 1.2 manual (See openEHR website). This
              doesn&#39;t affect standalong applications but does affect the DLLs. - added ADL keywords
              &quot;allow_archetype&quot;, to replace &quot;use_archetype&quot;, and &quot;include&quot; and
              &quot;exclude&quot; to define allowed and excluded sets of archetypes in an archetype slot. - slightly
              imprved visual display in GUI tool with a new icon for 1:N attributes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>&quot;mar2004&quot; Release - 31 Mar 2004 (BitKeeper cset 1.3.1.13)</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>separated out .Net DLL into its own toolkit - ADL language 1.1; ADL language manual 1.1 - VB.net
              sources updated - implements new interval syntax using &quot;||&quot;. - implementation of clinical ADL
              types CODED_TEXT and ORDINAL conforming to syntax defined in version 1.1 of manual. - initial
              experimental XML output for OWL as save option in ADL workbench. THis will be rewritten next version! -
              many small bugs and limitations of DLLs fixed, allowing more powerful interrogation of the Archetype
              ontology in memory from any .net language, or any application natively using the Eiffel backend (i.e. any
              C/C++ app, or Java via JNI).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>interim Release - 06 Feb 2004</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>ADL language 1.1; ADL language manual 0.9.9 - fixed REAL output error where &quot;.0&quot; forgotten
              for round numbers - numerous small GUI fixes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>interim Release - 27 Jan 2004</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>ADL language 1.0; ADL language manual 0.9.5 - added intervals as data types in dADL - intervals now
              require &quot;|&quot; delimiters, e.g. &quot;|100..200|&quot;, &quot;|&lt;100|&quot;.</li>

              <li>various minor bugs fixed in date/times, durations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>&quot;jan2004&quot; Release - 15 Jan 2004</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>ADL language 0.95 - Ontology model completely rewritten - now has its own functional interface
              independent of dADL. Tested with C# and VB through dotNet DLL build. - date/time types now have
              pattern-based constraint expressions - term references in cADL and dADL no longer need version id in
              terminlogy part - it is now optional; e.g. [ICD9AM::F72] can be used instead of [ICD9AM(2003)::F72] -
              introduction of clinical/scientific predefined type library, including constraint types (&quot;c_&quot;
              types) for: * Text, Coded_text, Code_phrase * Quantity, Ordinal, Countable * Partial_date, Partial_time,
              Partial_date_time New efficient syntax for coded term constraints: [terminology_id::code1, code2, code3,
              ...] New efficient syntax for ordinals: 0|[local::at0003], 1|[local::at0004], 2|[local::at0005] -
              improvements in GUI validator tree rendering of archetypes: * c_ordinals shown efficiently with codes and
              comments * c_terms shown efficiently with codes and comments * presence of invariants indicated -
              integration of ADL back-end with Clinician&#39;s Archetype Editor via dotNet: clinician-designed
              archetypes now save as regular ADL.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Initial Release - November 2003</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Basic validation functionality: - basic primitive types String, Integer, Real, Boolean - simple
              version of constraints for primitive types Date, Time, Date_time - basic implementation of ontology
              section of archetype</li>
