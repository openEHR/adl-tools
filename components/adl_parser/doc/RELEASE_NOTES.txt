Release history
---------------

interim release Subversion 63 - 14/May/2006
	ADL 1.4 compliant
	- enhancements: 
		- all ISO date/time constraint patterns now include the 'T' where appropriate, but parser 
		  tolerates a space for the moment, and silently substitutes a 'T' on output
		- ISO8601 duration constraint patterns now possible. See basic_types 
		  archetype in test archetypes area for examples
		- property attribute value in C_QUANTITY dADL sections now upgraded to CODE_PHRASE 
		  as defined by openEHR Archetype profile spec. Existing archetypes with old form of
		  	property = <"xxxxx"> 
		  still parse but are silently converted to
		  	property = <[openehr:xxxx]>
		  (note spaces converted to '_' as well)
		- clear_xxx routines added to ARCHETYPE_DESCRIPTION and ARCHETYPE_DESCRIPTION_ITEM
		  to allow all list attributes (e.g. author, keywords, details, other_details etc) 
		  to be cleared in one go.
		- implemented 'adl_version' and 'controlled' markers in ADL files. Existing ADL files
		  opened and saved with the ADL workbench or other tool using this parser will have
		  the latest ADL version written into them.
		- added functions to ARCHETYPE_ONTOLOGY to remove terms and constraints completely.
		- added a function to ARCHETYPE to generate list of unused term and constraint codes,
		  and to delete them from the ontology.

	- bug fixes:
		- string values in dADL sections that wrap to start of next line now parse properly
		- all ISO date/time values in dADL and cADL now parse with proper 'P' and 'T' characters;
		  if no 'T' present in value, it parses fine (for now) but a 'T' is included on output.

interim release Subversion 47 - 02/Apr/2006
	- bug fixes
		- fixed bug where Save on archetype opened from explorer tree had wrong 
		  directory

		- removed leading whitespace in dADL text fields

		- fixed incorrectly generated logical paths in ARCHETYPE

interim release Subversion 46 - 27/Mar/2006
	All archetypes parse, save and reparse as expected except SOAP Headings.

	- enhancements: 
		- now can have two archetypes in memory at once, due to getting rid 
		  of current_archteype from SHARED_ARCHETYPE_CONTEXT object

	- bug fixes:
		- rewrote Assertion expression rules, removed 96 reduce/reduce conflicts
		  in the cADL parser; 

		- fixed minor bug in path testing where a path ending in attr[obj_id] 
		  would match the OG structure when it should not

		- assertion expressions now parse properly with rewritten grammar for
		  boolean_expressions.

		- dADL text containing newlines no longer cause crash; newlines are 
		  preserved through parsing.


interim subversion release 4 - 12 Oct 2005

	- enhancements
		- more efficient implementation of DT_OBJECT_CONVERTER, which 
		  now checks far fewer types when comparing generic types

	- bugfixes
		- better structure of code with respect to use of 
		  SHARED_ADL_INTERFACE, which slved .Net DLL crash problem.

interim release Subversion revision 3 - 23 July 2005

	- changes:
	  library package structure significantly improved. Note that this will 
	  mean that .Net users will see that many classes are in a new namespace.
	  The main change is that the am package is now populated as described in
	  the Archetype Object Model (AOM) documentation.

	++++++++++++++ move to subversion ++++++++++++++

interim release BitKeeper cset 1.57 23/June/2005

	- enhancements
		- implemented CR-000138 Archetype level assertions. Updated
		  test cases, test archetypes.

		- minor improvements in open and save button behaviour in 
		  workbench GUI

		- in ASSERTION_FACTORY: 
		  functions "create_expr_unary_operator_xxx" etc replaced by one 
		  function:

			create_expr_unary_operator_node(an_operator: OPERATOR_KIND; 
						an_operand: EXPR_ITEM): EXPR_UNARY_OPERATOR
					-- operators with one operand, e.g. not x, -5 etc
				require
					an_operator_exists: an_operator /= Void
					an_operand_exists: an_operand /= Void

		  functions "create_expr_binary_operator_xxx" etc replaced by one 
		  function:

			create_expr_binary_operator_node(an_operator: OPERATOR_KIND; 
				a_left_operand, a_right_operand: EXPR_ITEM): 
									EXPR_BINARY_OPERATOR is
					-- operators with boolean results, e.g.
					-- and, or, xor, etc
				require
					an_operator_exists: an_operator /= Void
					a_left_operand_exists: a_left_operand /= Void
					a_right_operand_exists: a_right_operand /= Void

		- java wrapper changes:
			"create_expr_binary_operator_xxx" etc replaced by one function:
			create_expr_binary_operator_node (an_operator: INTEGER; h_a_left_operand, 
									h_a_right_operand: INTEGER): INTEGER
			-- REQUIRE
			-- an_operator_exists: {OPERATOR_KIND}.is_valid_operator(an_operator)
			-- a_left_operand_exists: a_left_operand /= void
			-- a_right_operand_exists: a_right_operand /= void

		    "create_expr_unary_operator_xxx" etc replaced by one function 
			create_expr_unary_operator_node (an_operator: INTEGER; 
										h_an_operand: INTEGER): INTEGER

			codes for an_operator argument given in openEHR AOM specification

		- the new classes OPERATOR_KIND and OPERATOR_TYPES are added. To 
		  make a call to one of the above functions, an OPERATOR_KIND 
		  object needs to be created using the c# syntax which has the 
		  effect of doing OPERATOR_KIND.make(integer value) or 
		  OPERATOR_KIND.make_from_string(string value)

	- bugs:
		- some bugs remain in the java wrapping; compiles ok, but runtime errors at 
		  assertion building. 
		  
		- More functions need to be wrapped for ARCHETYPE_DESCRIPTION, adding invariants
		  to ARCHETYPE etc.

release 'arch_desc' BitKeeper cset 1.56 19/June/2005

	- enhancements
		- implemented ARCHETYPE_DESCRIPTION class, parsing, and GUI
		  view. Upgraded all test archetypes.

		- added new class DT_OBJECT_CONVERTER, which performs generic
		  DT_ <-> object structure conversion. This enables the 
		  archetype description and any other dADL content to be 
		  converted automatically into objects, rather than requiring
		  hand-built routines.

interim release BitKeeper cset 1.50 01/June/2005

	- enhancements
		- News facility added: a news window will pop up the first time
		  the workbench is used with a new version.

interim release BitKeeper cset 1.49 30/May/2005

	- enhancements
		- DT structures (the internal representation of dADL sections)
		  are all generically generated from objects and are used to 
		  generate objects. This means that C_QUANTITYs, the description 
		  section and so on of an archetype are all handled by the one 
		  piece of code now. The ontology section is slightly more
		  complex, since its current modelling does not correspond
		  strictly to the object types used in the class
		  ARCHETYPE_ONTOLOGY. This will change in the future.

	- bug fixes
		- numerous small bugs fixed.

interim release BitKeeper cset 1.48 06/May/2005

	- bug fixes
		- implemented interval constraints of the form |100|, i.e. 
		  point intervals. Implemented for all ordered basic types,
		  i.e. integer, real, date, date_time, time, duration.

	- enhancements
		- implemented assumed values for primitive types and
		  domain types C_QUANTITY, C_CODED_TEXT, C_ORDINAL. 
		  C_PRIMITIVE and all subtypes, as well as C_DOMAIN_TYPE
		  have assumed_value, default_value, has_assumed_value and
		  set_assumed_value. Workbench GUI indicates assumed values.

interim release BitKeeper cset 1.46 - 05 May 2005

	- see adl_workbench release notes for general details.

	- enhancements
		- implemented assumed_value in primitive and domain types
	
interim release BitKeeper cset 1.39 25/Feb/2005

	- enhancements
		- C_QUANTITY now allows magnitude to be absent in inline dADL,
		  meaning open magnitude, with unit still constrained

		- support dADL2 style syntax, including nested generics

		- change paths to include anonymous nodes

	- bug fixes
		- an error whereby archetypes with include and exclude lists sent
		  the parser into an infinite loop is fixed.

		- empty C_DOMAIN_TYPE sections now parse, e.g. {C_QUANTITY <>}

		- embedded C_DOMAIN_TYPE sections with sibling non-C_DOMAIN_TYPE
		  sections now parse properly

interim release cset 1.38 - 19 Jan 2005

	- complete JNI wrapping for ADL parser. 
	- Many fixes in parser.
	- see http://www.deepthought.com.au for documentation on JNI wrapping
	  for Eiffel / C.
	- it is now recommended that users download the BitKeeper repository for
	  this project, since it contains the proper java directory structure.
	- this directory still contains the correct DLL, but will be replaced in
	  the near future by a proper distribution server.

interim release BitKeeper cset 1.32 - 29 July 2004

	- CADL_FACTORY class routine create_archetype_slot replaced
	  by two routines create_archetype_slot_anonymous and 
	  create_archetype_slot_identified

interim release BitKeeper cset 1.27 - 19 September 2004

	- enhancements

		- finished inline dADL support for C_DOMAIN_TYPE subtypes;
		  correctly serialises now; use of parantheses corrected

		- file names for serialisations other than ADL now replace
		  the '.adl' extension at the end rather than just appending
		  '.html', '.xml' or whatever.:wq

	- bug fixes
		
		- fix crash if icon not available (black square now shows, 
		  plus message indicating which icon missing).

		  shows, plus message indicating which icon missing).

interim release BitKeeper cset 1.23 - 09 September 2004

	- GUI fixes:

		- ADL_INTERFACE has an attribute called openehr_version which
		  contains the automatically version information from the software
		  repository - useful for reporting bugs, using in 'about' window.

interim release BitKeeper cset 1.3.1.30 - 29 July 2004

	- added archetype explorer control on left side of tool

	- fixed error where empty term definition text caused crash

	- corrected validation of found use_node paths

	- corrected error where sibling object nodes with same code
	  caused crash

interim release BitKeeper cset 1.3.1.22 - 05 May 2004

	- re-engineered object models as described in draft ADL 1.2
	  manual (See openEHR website). This doesn't affect standalong
	  applications but does affect the DLLs.

	- added ADL keywords "allow_archetype", to replace "use_archetype",
	  and "include" and "exclude" to define allowed and excluded sets of
	  archetypes in an archetype slot.

	- slightly imprved visual display in GUI tool with a new icon for 1:N
	  attributes.

"mar2004" Release - 31 Mar 2004 (BitKeeper cset 1.3.1.13)

	- separated out .Net DLL into its own toolkit

	- ADL language 1.1;  ADL language manual 1.1

	- VB.net sources updated

	- implements new interval syntax using "||".

	- implementation of clinical ADL types CODED_TEXT and ORDINAL 
	  conforming to syntax defined in version 1.1 of manual.

	- initial experimental XML output for OWL as save option in ADL
	  workbench. THis will be rewritten next version!

	- many small bugs and limitations of DLLs fixed, allowing more
	  powerful interrogation of the Archetype ontology in memory from
	  any .net language, or any application natively using the Eiffel
	  backend (i.e. any C/C++ app, or Java via JNI).

interim Release - 06 Feb 2004

	- ADL language 1.1;  ADL language manual 0.9.9

	- fixed REAL output error where ".0" forgotten for round numbers

	- added intervals as data types in dADL

	- intervals now require "|" delimiters, e.g. "|100..200|", "|<100|".

	- various minor bugs fixed in date/times, durations.

"jan2004" Release - 15 Jan 2004

	- ADL language 0.95

	- Ontology model completely rewritten - now has its own functional
	  interface independent of dADL. Tested with C# and VB through dotNet 
	  DLL build.

	- date/time types now have pattern-based constraint expressions

	- term references in cADL and dADL no longer need version id in
	  terminlogy part - it is now optional; e.g. [ICD9AM::F72] can be used
	  instead of [ICD9AM(2003)::F72]

	- introduction of clinical/scientific predefined type library, including
	  constraint types ("c_" types) for:
		* Text, Coded_text, Code_phrase
	  	* Quantity, Ordinal, Countable
		* Partial_date, Partial_time, Partial_date_time

	  New efficient syntax for ordinals:
	  	0|[local::at0003], 1|[local::at0004], 2|[local::at0005]

	- improvements in GUI validator tree rendering of archetypes:
		* c_ordinals shown efficiently with codes and comments
		* c_terms shown efficiently with codes and comments
		* presence of invariants indicated

	- integration of ADL back-end with Clinician's Archetype Editor via
	  dotNet: clinician-designed archetypes now save as regular ADL.
